AEM run mode configuraions using OSGi R6 Annotations


This project demonstrates the basics of using AEM run mode configurations and read them using  OSGi Declarative Services annotations.
Sample OSGI configuration files and services are included in this project. This sample project rely on the custom run mode which 
need to be added either in the sling.properties or start script.
