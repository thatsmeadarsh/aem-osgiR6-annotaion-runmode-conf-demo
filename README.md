AEM run mode configuraions using OSGi R6 Annotations


This project demonstrates the basics of using AEM run mode configurations and read them using  OSGi Declarative Services annotations.
Sample OSGI service is incuded in this project. Download the entire project. This can be compiled from the root pom file location and a jar file will be created. This jar file can be uploaded throught the AEM system console interface. The intention of this is to only show the working sample code. This sample project rely on the custom run mode which need to be added in the sling.properties or the start script.
